Disabled under SSI rules means a person has a medically determinable physical or mental impairment, which: results in the inability to do any substantial gainful activity, and has lasted or can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than 12 months. Substantial gainful activity is defined as the ability to work and earn $1,130 per month. If someone is working, there are ways that could lower the monthly gross wages below $1,130. The Social Security Administration no longer recognizes drug addiction and alcoholism (DA & A) as disabling conditions. Someone with another impairment should still file. If the DA & A does not contribute to the impairment, they could be found to be disabled. Anyone who is disabled, should be encouraged to file for benefits.<br><br>    To determine SSI eligibility and payment amounts, SSA considers the applicant's income and resources.

Resources are things which a person owns such as; cash, bank accounts, land, vehicles, personal property, life insurance, anything that can be converted to cash and used for food and shelter. There are many exceptions/exclusions regarding income and resources. Anyone that is disabled should be encouraged to file for SSI.<br><br> To be eligible for SSI, an applicant must be a US citizen or one of certain alien categories. There are many categories of lawful aliens that would be eligible for SSI, contact a Social Security Office or the National 800 number 1-800-772-1213 to inquire.<br> <br> Anyone applying for SSI will be asked about their medical history; doctors, tests, and medications. The claim representative (CR) will ask questions about the person's income, resources, and living arrangements. The CR will ask the applicant to attest to the truthfulness of their answers.<br><br> <b>Appeals:</b><br><br> If an application is denied, there is a 65 day appeals period (60 days plus 5 days mailing).
