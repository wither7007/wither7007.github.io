                I had been out of work over a year, living on unemployment and a severance package. I'd been
                drinking every day for two years. Now I was running out of health and money. The rent was over due.
            </p>

            <p>
                I went to get some liquor one night. When I returned, I heard the voices of my landlord, my
                ex-girlfriend
                and another
                friend coming from inside my apartment. I knew I would be walking into an intervention. I have no idea
                what I
                was thinking,
                but
                I zipped my
                coat, turned around, and silently walked into a cold winter.
            </p>

            <p>
                I spent that night in the U of M Library, across the street from my apartment, drinking my rum with a
                Coke, sleeping in
                the stacks. The next morning I knew I was fucked. I'd worked at the University for 20 years, and was
                familiar
                with the sleeping spots, free food, open showers; but now homeless, it was all different and
                threatening.
                It took a couple days but eventually someone called the campus police. I had an outstanding DWI warrant
                and was
                hauled to jail. I suffered an alcohol withdrawal seizure there and spent a couple days in County
                Hospital, getting some badly needed magnesium and other IV's.

            <p>Back in jail I told another inmate about
                my situation and wondered if I could stay in jail til I figured something out. He correctly told me,
                being a first offense, they would cut me loose in the morning&#8212 he also mentioned something about a
                place
                called St. Stephens.
            <p>

                I left jail and wandered around the city a couple days, making a mental note of
                the rail heights on the overpasses. I finally ended up in the library and began researching St. Stephen.
                After a couple hours searching I was able to locate the church, where I was told to go to Cental
                Lutheran
                Church and talk to an outreach worker. At Central Lutheran I was set up with a visiting psychologist,
                given a note
                saying I
                was a crazy alcoholic and sent across the street to request benefits . I went back to St. Stephens that
                night and finally found a bed. I stayed at St. Stephens for a couple wickedly cold nights. On Monday I
                was
                sent to Simpsons shelter where I was entered in a "lottery".
            </p>
            <p>

                I won. My prize, a 30 day reprieve
                from the February night and an introduction to the Minnesota social safety net.
            </p>
            <p>I eventually was hooked up with a social worker who found me the Missions Inc. (personally, highly
                recommended)

                group of programs
                <span>&#8212</span>
            <p>This is where I write this story today, inside, on a Febrary Wednesday morning.</p>
