            My background is in databases and system-wide financial systems at the University of Minnesota.
            In addition to an unhealthy relationship with vodka, in the early days of the internet I was too busy
            balancing system balance sheets and making sure payroll processed to notice much what was going on
            in the
            web world.
            <p>
                I started this thinking WordPress
                , but since I had a <i>really </i> lot of free time on my hand, decided to develop from scratch.
            </p>
            <p>
                Given the small data set I used raw JSON as my primary data structure. I eventually chose Google Sheets
                as my data store, mostly because I wanted to learn more about the product. Still not sure about Sheets,
                but do like its Javascript (over Excel
                VBA--blech!) and collaboration capabilties. Obviously if the dataset grows larger, I'd switch to
                a real database.
            </p>
            Finally all the maps API and data management stuff I did in Python. I'm not including that in my repo as
            it's
            kinda confusing, and the API is changing and lacks proper documentation. I'll say though, it
            looks interesting.
            <p>
                I learned a lot creating this site (which was my primary purpose any way), but didn't necessarily
                go back to fix the less than ideal early implementations. My code and, perhaps
                more importantly the data, is publicly available on my <a
                    href="https://github.com/wither7007/wither7007.github.io">GitHub</a>
                site.
            <p>
                If you think of a better way to present this information, give it a shot and let me know what you
                come up with.
