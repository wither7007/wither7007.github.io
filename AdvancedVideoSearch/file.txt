In the movie Ghost
the joke is built on a rock-solid boundation
the movie would still work played perfectly straight
The notion of a ghost-extermination squad taking on 
the paramal hordes makes a compelling setup for a big-budget adventure of any stripe
Indeed, the film as it stands frequently allows time to pass without a gag
But then comes the punch line: the characters are funny
And because weâ€™ve been hooked by the story, the humor the characters provide is all the richer.
